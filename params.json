{"name":"8bitdemos","tagline":"","body":"### A collection of early '90s-style demos, written in JavaScript\r\n\r\nTo simulate [Mode 13h](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h), a small (and as of yet, highly unoptimized) lib called [Canvas256](https://github.com/8bitdemos/demos/blob/gh-pages/js/canvas256.js) is used.\r\n\r\nCanvas256 provides a 320x180 HTML5 canvas, which can be manipulated in 256-color palette mode (palette effects such as old school fire are doable).\r\n\r\nThe demos have been tested on (best results in descending order):\r\n* Mozilla Firefox 27\r\n* Apple Safari 7\r\n* Internet Explorer 11\r\n* Google Chrome 32\r\n\r\nCurrently (and to the best of my knowledge), only FF and Safari support nearest-neighbor interpolation. IE and Chrome instead use bilinear interpolation, which doesn't look as crisp.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
